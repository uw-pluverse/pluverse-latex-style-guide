## always use `first`, `second`, but not `firstly`, `secondly`.

[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/first-or-firstly#:~:text=Even%20though%20they%20are%20both,the%20best%20bet%20for%20most)

## use `less` with uncountable nouns and `fewer` with plural countable nouns

`Less` is sometimes used with a plural countable noun (e.g., less cars), particularly in conversation. However, this is grammatically incorrect.

## avoid using `very`

For example, `very effective` can be replaced with `highly effective`. 

You might also consider `remarkably effective` or `amazingly effective`, though Chengnian does not like them much.

## avoid using `lots of` and `a lot of`

From the [grammarly post](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/lots-or-plenty-of/)


> Although lots and plenty are acceptable in academic writing, their
> usage is considered to be informal. In formal academic writing, it
> is more appropriate to use many, much, and more.
