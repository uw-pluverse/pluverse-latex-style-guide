## that v.s. which

* In a defining clause, use that.
* In non-defining clauses, use which.

## always use `first`, `second`, but not `firstly`, `secondly`.

## use `less` with uncountable nouns and `fewer` with plural countable nouns

`Less` is sometimes used with a plural countable noun (e.g., less cars), particularly in conversation. However, this is grammatically incorrect.

## use `(see Section 3)` or `(details in Section 3)` for forward reference.

Note that 
"cf." is not the appropriate abbreviation for referring to details in a specific section. "cf." stands for "confer" in Latin, meaning "compare" or "consult," and is used to direct the reader to other material for comparison, not for additional details.

## It is correct to use either `positive` or `comparative` form with `compared to` 

For example, 

`ME:` 
> Which version is grammatically correct?

  1. Company A has a larger market share, compared to Company B.
  2. Company A has a large market share, compared to Company B.
  

`ChatGPT:`
> The first sentence is grammatically correct:

  Company A has a larger market share, compared to Company B.

  This sentence correctly uses the comparative form "larger" to compare the market
  shares of Company A and Company B. The second sentence,
  "Company A has a large market share, compared to Company B," is not incorrect, but it is less precise because it does not explicitly indicate the comparative nature of the market shares.

## avoid using `try`, use `attempt`, `strive`, etc.

`Try` is an informal word.

## avoid using `very`

For example, `very effective` can be replaced with `highly effective`. 

You might also consider `remarkably effective` or `amazingly effective`, though Chengnian does not like them much.

## avoid using `lots of` and `a lot of`

From the [grammarly post](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/lots-or-plenty-of/)


> Although lots and plenty are acceptable in academic writing, their
> usage is considered to be informal. In formal academic writing, it
> is more appropriate to use many, much, and more.


## no extra period after `etc.` if `etc.` is at the end of a sentence.

Correct: `X......, etc.`

Incorrect: `X......., etc..`

## use article words before countable singular noun

When a noun is countable and singular, you need to use `a/an/the` to quantify it.

## no use of `such as` and `etc` together

These two phrases cannot be used together. For example, `such as apple, organge, etc.`.

If you use `such as`, then you should strictly follow the structure `such as A, B, C and D`.

## never start with a sentence with a number or lower-case letters.

For example

```
ddmin can handle ...;
```

In stead, you should write

```
The algorithm ddmin can handle ...;
```

Similarly, instead of writing `1 apple a day is good for your body`, you should write `One apple a day ...`.
