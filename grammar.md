## always use `first`, `second`, but not `firstly`, `secondly`.

[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/first-or-firstly#:~:text=Even%20though%20they%20are%20both,the%20best%20bet%20for%20most)

## use `less` with uncountable nouns and `fewer` with plural countable nouns

`Less` is sometimes used with a plural countable noun (e.g., less cars), particularly in conversation. However, this is grammatically incorrect.

## avoid using `very`

For example, `very effective` can be replaced with `remarkably effective`, `highly effective`, or `amazingly effective`.
